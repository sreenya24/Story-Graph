# Link to the final repository 
[Story Graph by Team 15](https://github.com/sreenya24/Story-Graph)

# Directories
## Images
- Contains all the training images used for face recognition by FaceNet
## test
- Contains the test images used for face recognition by FaceNet to check the accuracy of the model
## project
- Contains the videos that are used to run story graph on
    - `data` contains a small episode used to evaluate intermediate stages
    - `episodes` contain 2 episodes from the show Big Bang Theory
# Files
## better_story_graph
- Contains the final code for the project run on Season 1 Episode 3 of Big Bang Theory
## story_graph
- Contains the code implemented in a slightly lesser productive way where the optimization is done scene-wise instead of episode-wise. It has simpler loss functions.
## face_recognition
- Contains the code for face recognition using FaceNet
## requirements.txt
- Contains the list of all the packages used in the project
## Project presentation
- Contains the presentation for the project
